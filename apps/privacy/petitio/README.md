# Petitio — privacy rights request desk

Educational, browser-local prototype of a privacy-operations desk for individual rights requests (access, erasure, rectification, portability, opt-out of sale). It is built to make the *decision logic* inspectable: a deterministic deadline clock, an explicit request state machine whose refusals explain themselves, duplicate detection, multi-system reconciliation with redaction, and a hash-chained audit log.

> Educational prototype. Not legal advice, not a compliance certification, and not a claim of experience with any commercial privacy platform (OneTrust, BigID and similar products are referenced only as context). All people, systems and emails are synthetic (`*.example`).

## Why it exists

Rights-request handling is where privacy programs are measured against hard dates. Most demos show a ticket queue; this one shows the *rules* a queue has to enforce:

- a statutory window that depends on jurisdiction and is measured differently (calendar months vs calendar days),
- an extension that is only valid if it is requested in time and is not longer than the law allows,
- a response that cannot be prepared while a hold lacks a written justification,
- a response packet that withholds third-party data and anything whose identity does not reconcile,
- an audit trail whose integrity can be verified rather than asserted.

## Key workflows

1. **Docket triage.** Requests sort by clock status (overdue → at-risk → on-track → closed/rejected) and days remaining. Each row carries a deadline ribbon: statutory window, hatched extension, elapsed fill, and the as-of marker.
2. **Advance a request.** Every action valid for the current stage is listed. Blocked actions stay visible with the exact reason (for example `Lookups still outstanding for: support`). Terminal stages accept nothing.
3. **Record simulated system lookups.** For a request in `collecting`, record a result per system of record (found / not found, record id, subject email on file, fields with a third-party flag). Nothing is actually queried.
4. **Holds.** In `review`, apply a hold (legal hold, legal-obligation retention, fraud prevention, ongoing transaction, third-party rights) to one system. A hold without a justification blocks `prepare-response`; a justified hold produces a partial response with the exclusion listed.
5. **Response packet.** Derived live from results and holds: disclosures, redactions (third-party data, identity conflict), exclusions, conflicts, and a `partial` flag. Redacted values can be revealed by a reviewer and the packet exported as JSON.
6. **Extension.** Record a single extension with reason, days and the date the requester was notified. The engine refuses an extension notified after the initial window, longer than the profile maximum, dated after the case-file as-of date (the requester cannot have been told yet), or requested on a closed or rejected request; each refusal is shown with its code and appended to the audit log.
7. **Import / export.** Import a `petitio.casefile` v1 JSON (bounded and validated), export the current case file, export the audit log. State is in memory and resets on refresh by design.
8. **Audit log.** Every action and every refusal is appended with a SHA-256 hash chained to the previous entry. "Verify chain" recomputes every hash; "Simulate tampering" edits a copy to show detection.

## Algorithm

### Deadline clock (`src/engine/deadline.ts`)

| Profile | Window | Extension | Notice rule | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EU-GDPR, UK-GDPR | 1 calendar month | up to 2 further calendar months, once | notice within the initial month | GDPR Art. 12(3) ([gdprhub](https://gdprhub.eu/Article_12_GDPR), [EDPB](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sme/be-compliant/respect-individuals-rights_en), [ICO guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/right-of-access/what-should-we-consider-when-responding-to-a-request/)) |
| US-CA-CCPA | 45 calendar days | up to 45 additional days, once | notice within the first 45 days | Cal. Civ. Code 1798.130(a)(2) ([statute text](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/pdf/ccpa_statute_eff_20260101.pdf), [OAG summary](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)) |

"Calendar month" uses the corresponding-date rule: 15 March + 1 month = 15 April; 31 January + 1 month = 28/29 February (last day of a shorter month). The month-end rule follows ICO guidance; the EU regulation itself does not define day-counting, so this is a documented modelling choice. Status bands: `overdue` when the as-of date is past the effective due date, `at-risk` within the final 5 days (configurable constant `AT_RISK_DAYS`), otherwise `on-track`. Day counts are whole UTC days; no business-day calendar is applied.

`requestExtension(request, input, asOf?)` runs its guards in a fixed order so refusals are stable: terminal stage (`closed`/`rejected` → `INVALID_TRANSITION`), already extended (`ALREADY_EXTENDED`), input validation (integer days, non-blank reason, real calendar notice date not before receipt → `INVALID_EXTENSION_INPUT`), profile maximum (`EXTENSION_TOO_LONG`), notice inside the initial window (`EXTENSION_TOO_LATE`) and finally — only when the caller supplies `asOf`, as the UI does with the case-file date — a notice dated after `asOf` (`INVALID_EXTENSION_INPUT`, "notice dated in the future relative to the as-of date"). The importer applies the statutory guards but not the stage or as-of guards (see Limitations).

### State machine (`src/engine/workflow.ts`)

Extension arithmetic is deliberately conservative at month ends: the maximum additional window is calculated from the truncated initial due date. For a request received on 31 January 2026, the model gives 28 February initially and 28 April after the maximum extension, rather than 30 April under a three-months-from-receipt calculation. This is a teaching-model choice, not a legal interpretation or a deadline calculator for real requests.

`received → identity-check → verified → collecting → review → response-ready → closed`, with `rejected` reachable from any non-terminal stage. Guards: `begin-collection` needs a passed identity check; `send-to-review` needs a result for every system of record; `prepare-response` needs every active hold to have a justification; `reject` needs a reason from a fixed list; the third failed identity attempt rejects the request with `identity-unverified`. `transition()` is pure and returns a new request; `availableActions()` returns the same guard results as explanations.

The three-attempt threshold and identity-check outcomes are simulation constants, not an identity-proofing policy suitable for production.

### Duplicate detection (`src/engine/duplicates.ts`)

A later request is flagged when an earlier, non-rejected request of the same type from the same pseudonym (or the same trimmed, lower-cased email) was received within 30 days. The decision stays with the analyst; the engine does not auto-reject.

### Reconciliation and redaction (`src/engine/reconcile.ts`)

Per system result: a stored subject email that differs from the verified requester marks an identity conflict and withholds every field of that system; fields marked `thirdParty` are withheld; systems under an active hold are excluded; systems with no record are omitted. The packet is `partial` if anything was withheld. Simplification: a hold excludes a system for every request type; real programs distinguish exemptions per right.

### Audit chain (`src/engine/audit.ts`)

`hash = SHA-256(JSON[seq, at, actor, requestId, action, detail, prevHash])` using the Web Crypto API. Verification recomputes each hash and checks `prevHash` linkage and sequence. This is tamper-*evident* within a session, not tamper-*proof*: the log lives in memory and an attacker who controls the tab can rewrite the whole chain. It demonstrates the technique, not a trusted timestamping service.

### Import bounds (`src/engine/casefile.ts`)

1,000,000 bytes, 500 requests, 50 systems, nesting depth 8, string length 4,000; every enum and date format is validated; duplicate ids are rejected; unknown properties are dropped rather than carried into state.

## Architecture

```
src/engine/     pure TypeScript, no React: types, deadline, workflow, duplicates, reconcile, audit, casefile
src/fixtures/   demo-casefile.json (synthetic, labelled)
src/ui/         Docket, CaseDetail, Ribbon, StageRail, AuditDialog, ImportDialog, download helper
src/App.tsx     in-memory session state and wiring
```

React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 + Vite 7; Vitest 4 with jsdom and Testing Library; fast-check for the date-arithmetic property test; Radix UI Dialog and Tooltip for accessible primitives; self-hosted variable fonts via Fontsource (Bricolage Grotesque, Source Serif 4). No router: single view, `base: './'`.

## Tests

`npm test` (`vitest run`) prints `Tests  79 passed (79)` in 5 files (measured 4 Oct 2026; engine 73 + UI integration 6; see `EVIDENCE.md` for the RED/GREEN record, including eleven review-driven tests and the October 2026 extension-guard tests, all added red-first):

- `deadline.test.ts` (29): calendar arithmetic incl. a property test over ±5,000 days, profile encodings, status bands, extension refusals, extension input validation, and the stage/as-of guards (terminal stages refused, notice after the as-of date refused, malformed as-of date, guard order, a property over every notice date in the initial window).
- `workflow.test.ts` (15): every guard, immutability, attempt exhaustion, explanations.
- `reconcile.test.ts` (9): duplicate rules and packet assembly.
- `audit.test.ts` (20): chain linkage, tamper and deletion detection, import bounds and schema rejection, strict calendar dates, imported extensions held to the statutory guards, invalid-input regression (importer returns `ok:false`, never throws), and the documented acceptance of a historical extension on a request that has since closed.
- `App.test.tsx` (6): integration through the rendered UI (written after the UI as regression coverage; the engine tests were written first), including the on-screen refusal of a notice dated after the as-of date.

## Data handling

- Browser-local only. No network requests after the static assets load (verified in the QA audit: the only host contacted is the local preview server).
- No `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` or IndexedDB; refresh resets to the bundled fixture. Continuity is by JSON export/import.
- No real personal data. Fixture people are fictional, emails use `people.example`.
- Identity proofing, system lookups and delivery are simulated by recording outcomes; nothing is sent or queried.

## Limitations

- Jurisdiction profiles cover three regimes with one window each; they do not model fee rules, manifestly-unfounded assessments, special categories of requests, or the many US state laws.
- Day counting is calendar-based UTC; business days, public holidays and "receipt" nuances are not modelled.
- Hold semantics are simplified (a hold excludes a system for any right).
- The audit chain is session-scoped tamper evidence, not a trusted log.
- Single-user; no authentication or roles beyond labels in history entries.
- `requestExtension` refuses terminal stages (`closed`, `rejected`) and, when the caller passes the case-file `asOf` as the UI does, a notice dated after it. The importer (`casefile.ts`) deliberately does not apply those two guards: a historical file may legitimately record an extension on a request that has since closed, so it is accepted as long as the statutory maximum, notice window, receipt order and reason hold. An imported file can therefore carry an extension that the UI would refuse to record today; it cannot carry one that breaks the statutory rules.

## JD evidence (educational mapping)

Privacy tech workflow (rights automation concepts), analytical/design thinking (explicit guards and explanations), quality deliverables (exportable packet and audit log), HTML/CSS/TypeScript, API-style JSON schema with validation. It does not demonstrate product experience with OneTrust or any vendor platform, and does not establish legal expertise.
